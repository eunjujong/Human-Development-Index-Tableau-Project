# Human-Development-Index-Tableau-Project
This Tableau visualization will utilize the Human Development Index (HDI) developed by the United Nations (UN) to provide information on a country's development. The HDI  measures the country's overall achievemen in its socioeconomic dimensions. These socioeconomics dimensions are based on a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. In this visualization, we will use the HDI dataset along with the Gender Develop Index (GDI), Life Expectancy, and Democracy Index datasets to assess different factors that drive the socioeconomic dimentions of the HDI. 

The HDI, GDI, and Life Expectancy data can be found at Uniited Nations Human Development Data Center: https://hdr.undp.org/en/data The Democracy Index data is available at Gapminder: https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/democracy-index/. The information about the classification of countries by GNI Per Captipa is available at the World Bank database: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906519-world-bank-country-and-lending-groups.
